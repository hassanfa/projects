Procedure to remove overrepresented sequences:

1. run convertToCol.sh to convert your "fastq.gz" file to a column format. It will output to stdout (i.e. terminal). You can
pipe the output into separate file or just pipe it into the next script in step 2. But for removing overrepresented
sequences, we need this as a separate file.

2. run sequenceCount.sh to count how many time a sequence appears in the fastq file. The output for this one is stdout
by default, and it can read input from convertToCol.sh. Make sure your write the output of this file to a plain text
file.

3. run extractOverrepRawRNAseq.sh on step 2's output to get a list of overrepreented sequences. Again, the output is
stdout. This script will get list of overrepresented sequences if and only if they are 0.1% of total number of reads. I
highly recommend to run this "before" removing rRNA, and after truncating adaptors. 

4. finally, run removeSequence.sh with two input files: first input from step one, and second input from step 3. Output
for this script is also stdout, so make sure you assign it to a proper file. The output after this step will be a
conventional fastq file format, which can be fed into various sequence processing softwares.


Example:
#conver to collumn
./convertToCol.sh ../Sample01_12AH_0022_control/Sample01_12AH_0022_control.tc.rmrRNA.fastq.gz > Sample01.col.fastq

#count sequence occurences
./sequenceCount.sh Sample01.col.fastq > Sample01.col.fastq.sequenceCount 

#extract list overrepresented sequences
./extractOverrepRawRNAseq.sh Sample01.col.fastq.sequenceCount > Sample01.col.fastq.overrep

#remove overpresented sequences and convert back to fastq format.
./removeSequence.sh Sample01.col.fastq Sample01.col.fastq.overrep > Sample01.col.remmoveOverRep.fastq
